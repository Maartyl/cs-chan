					<section data-markdown>
						## chan idea

						- connect *independent susbsystems*
							- susbystems require only:
								- name and location of channel
								- to reference Chan.dll
						- *constant API* for any 'distance':
							- same process
							- different process
							- different computer
						- sending *immutable messages* over 'channels' (chans)
							- chan is abstraction of *asynchronous queue*
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## motivation

						- breaking dependency, ...
						- many small apps need to exchange messages between remote components
						- personal need for such framework
							- I haven't found any library matching my idea.
							<!-- - <small>(project: collecting and 'sorting' problem logs from warehouse and moving it to people at office)</small> -->
						- something many people could find useful
						- interesting learning experience
					</section>

					<!-- chan system overview  -->
					<section data-markdown>
						## chan system overview

						Most logic is hidden behind *ChanStore* with simple API.
						- *create net/local chan*
						- *access sender/receiver* (ends of a chan)
							- If provides host and port can access net-chan created in differnt ChanStore.
								- That ChanStore has to start a server on that port.
						- uses URIs as chan identifiers
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## chan identification

						Chans are accessed with URIs with 'chan' scheme.

						- *no authority*: local chan (or local end of net chan)
							```javascript
							"chan:ui/events" //example
							```
						- *with authority*: remote end of net-chan
							```javascript
							"chan://myserver.cz:6789/chat/messages" //example
							```

					<!-- details -->
					<section data-markdown>
						## chan details

						Ideas behind implementing chans and ChanStore.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## chan types

						- *async local*
							- internally stores *2 queues of 'promises'*
								- [waiting for send] and [waiting for receive]
							- queues are limited in legth, after which they block the thread
						- *net*
							- Serializes and sends messages over *TCP* connection.
						- other
							- implementing other would not require any change of the rest of the system
							- possible fake: cancelled; timeout....
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## chan factory

						- Factories differ per *distribution type*
							- *FirstOnly* - each single chan works like this - 'evenly' distributes messages between all receivers
							- *Broadcast* - each receiver receives all messages (simulated by creating different chans in a factory)
						- Behaves like a factory but does not create a chan every time.
						- Distribution type can be specified when creating the chan in
						  ChanStore and defaults to FirstOnly (which adds almost no overhead)
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## `SerDes`

						Refers to `ISerDes&lt;T&gt;`

						Typesafe serialization, deserialization interface

						Default SerDes is provided in NetChanConfig for `[Serializable]` types.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## chan store

						- stores dictionaries
						- *locals*
							- maps URIs to 'tuples' of factory and server (null for local chans)
						- *clients to remote chans*
							- maps message-types to caches
								- cache maps URIs to factories
							- caches must be *initialized* with mainly SerDes
								- Required for default SerDes too: returns task that fails if any exception happens in cache.
							- *Different for senders and receivers* for they are unrelated.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<!-- net chan -->
					<section data-markdown>
						## net chan

						Sends messages over *custom binary TCP protocol* that can send messages of up to *64KiB* (when serialized).

						The protocol is designed to be able to send fragmented messages of up to 4GiB but that is not implemented and using it would probably signal bad design anyway...
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## net chan protocol

						Each end sends 'packets' that consist of a *header* (8 bytes) and possibly *data*. Header always contains length of data (in 2 bytes) if there are any.

						All values are represented in big-endiand.

						There are different types of headers, like `MSG`, `PING`, `CLOSE` ...

						For complete list and details see [documentation](https://github.com/Maartyl/cs-chan/tree/master/Chan/NetChan#protocol).

				</section>

				<!-- chat -->
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						# Chat
						##### application example
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						Simple chat aplication that uses *chans for communication* and shows *connector* idea.
						![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maartyl/cs-chan/master/Chat/screenshot.png)
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## chat idea

						- looks and works like terminal application
						- as little code as possible should depend on GUI
							- so it can be easily replaced
						- user can issue *commands* (like IRC)
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## chat ui

						- UI consist simply of
							- *command bar* at the bottom of the window
							- *text area* which shows messages, errors and notifications
								- can be swapped with *help area* which shows help
								- application starts in help mode
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## chat commands

						All commands start with ':'

						Any line not starting with ':' is interpreted as *:text* command with rest as argument.
						If line wasn't just whitespace, it is trimmed and fed into *:send*.

						All that (and any other input) is part of command *CmdParseRun* which
						hides all logic and lets any part of code run the same command as user.
						It is used to *run command line arguments*.

					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## known problems
						(1)
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## server cannot be behind NAT

						- **problem**
							- upon request server creates TCP listener at random port and sends that port to client
							- does not get NAT translated
						- *solution*
							- single TCP listender instead of WCF call.
								- which chan to use is determined during handshake
							- big change
							- WCF can do authentication and I don't know how to write it properly with just TCP.
								- I will fix it once I understand the problematic.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## summary

						- chans *connect independent* subsystems
						- chans are created in and accessed through *ChanStore*
						- net-chan uses *lasting TCP* connection to push messages
						- chat uses dispatch on strings (commands) to run actions
						---
						- currently **does not work over NAT**
